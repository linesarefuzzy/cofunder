          <h1>21<sup>st</sup> Century Job Creation</h1>
          <p>The Working World has coined a development strategy that
creates quality, lasting jobs anchored in local communities. Over
six years of work, we have invested more than $2 million dollars
in job creation with a 95%+ project maturation rate, without ever
creating debt in the neighborhoods we serve. We started in Argentina, where we showed that our methods could work, then
proved that they can be replicated in Nicaragua, and now, with
our latest office in New York, we are out to bring innovative
21st century job creation to the U.S.</p>
<p>Democratic worker control puts into practice the idea that every
contributing member of a business should have a voice in the
decision- making process. W orker-owners, as they are often
called, meet in regularly scheduled assemblies where business
decisions are either made consensually or delegated to smaller
working groups

<p class="copy_front_low"><strong>We are seeking investments from
$5 to $50,000 for a two-year term</strong>. This <em>“mezzanine”</em>
debt is the second level of protection after first-loss

loan fund with a strong focus on impact. Every dollar
invested at this level can yield from two to six
dollars in subsequent investments.</p>
